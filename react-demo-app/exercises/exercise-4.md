# Exercise 4

1. Move the array of cars to `index.js`.

2. Pass the array of cars as `props` into the CarTool component.

3. Create a new component named `ToolHeader`. The Tool Header component has the same element structure as the header in Car Tool and Color Tool.

4. Parameterize the `ToolHeader` so the `ToolHeader` component can be used in the Car Tool and the Color Tool component trees.

5. Replace the headers in Car Tool and Color Tool with the new `ToolHeader` component.

6. Ensure it works!
