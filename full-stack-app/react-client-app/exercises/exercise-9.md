# Exercise 9

1. Utilize the `useForm` hook in the Color Form and Edit Car Row components.

2. You will observe that both Color Tool and Car Tool manage a list of objects. The list of objects are stored as state, and each tool uses similar stateful logic (such as append) to manage the list of objects. Create a new custom hook named `useList` to manage the list of objects and organize the stateful logic. Then, utilize the new hook in Color and Car Tool similar to how we utilized the `useForm` in the various form components.

## Bonus

1. Place two buttons above the list of colors in the color list component.

2. The first button says "Sort Asc" and the second button says "Sort Desc".

3. When the "Sort Asc" button is clicked sort the color list by name in ascending order.

4. When the "Sort Desc" button is clicked sort the color list by name in descending order.

5. Add a third button (next to the other two buttons) with the text "Toggle Hexcode".

6. When the "Toggle Hexcode" button is clicked it toggles between showing/hiding the hexcode value for each color in the list.

7. Use some of the many techniques we have learned to organize and implement the solution.
